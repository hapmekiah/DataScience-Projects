Welcome to the Alpha Dreamers Consortium project! This project focuses on managing risk associated with customer defaults in a banking setting by leveraging exploratory data analysis (EDA) and Machine learning techniques.

Project Overview: Alpha dreamers consortium is a bank that provides loans to its customers. One of the primary concerns of the bank is to minimize risk of customer defaults, which can significantly impact its financial stability. To address the issue we conducted an in-depth analysis of the bank's customer data to identify patterns and factors contributing to defaults.

Exploratory Data Analysis: We perfomed the Exploratory Data Analysis to gain insights into the characteristics of customers who default on their loans, this involved
Data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure data quality and consistency
Statistical analysis to identify trends, correlations and outliers in the data
Visualizations of key metrics and distributions using plots and charts

Machine Leraning Model: To predict customer defaults accurately we created a machine learning model based on the insights gathered from the Exploratory Data Analysis, the steps involved are as follows:
Data preparation: We preapred the data for modelling by encoding categorial variables , handling missing values and scalling numerical variables
Model selection: We selected the logistic regression model
Model training: We trained the selected model on training data.
Model Evaluation: We evaluated the model's perfomance using metrics such as accuracy to assess its ability to predict customer defaults.
Deployment: We deployed the model to make predictions on data.
